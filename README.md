Data Analyses by Aqeel Ahamadh 

# Sales Analysis and Visualization Project

## Overview

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of sales data, focusing on the Internet Sales, Product, Customer, and Budget tables. The process involved meticulous data cleaning and transformation using SQL to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

- <span style="color: green;">**Internet Sales Table:**</span> Meticulous cleaning and transformation were applied to ensure data accuracy, involving handling missing values, correcting data types, and addressing any anomalies.

- <span style="color: blue;">**Product Table:**</span> Utilizing SQL queries, I standardized product information, resolved discrepancies, and ensured uniformity, enhancing the overall quality of the product data.

- <span style="color: purple;">**Customer Table:**</span> Applied effective data cleaning techniques using SQL, focusing on improving data quality by addressing duplicate entries and ensuring consistency.

## Power BI Integration and Dashboard Creation

The cleaned datasets were seamlessly integrated into Power BI for advanced analysis and dashboard creation. Three distinct dashboards were developed to provide in-depth insights into sales, products, and customers.

### Sales Dashboard

Offering insights into customer behavior and demographics, this dashboard includes visualizations on customer distribution, purchasing patterns, and customer lifetime value.

## Data Modeling and Visualization

The data modeling process involved establishing meaningful relationships between the tables, contributing to the creation of insightful visualizations. Utilizing Power BI's robust capabilities, I designed interactive dashboards and reports that offer a clear and concise representation of the sales data.

## Conclusion

This project not only demonstrates proficiency in SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization but also showcases the ability to create specialized dashboards for a comprehensive understanding of sales, products, and customer dynamics.
